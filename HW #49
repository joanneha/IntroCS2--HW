# Team The Music of the Night -- Clio Chen, Joanne Ha

# HW #49: CSV -> HTML
# 2015-05-11

# Write a Python script (genTable.py) that will read a CSV file (testdata.csv)
# in the same directory and use its contents to generate an HTML file(table.html).
# When rendered in a browser, this HMTL file will yield a table containing the
# data in the CSV file.

# File I: Reading the incoming testdata.csv file
instream = open('testdata.csv', 'r')
a = instream.readlines()
print a # testing to see that the CSV file is in the correct place

# File O: Writing and outputting a HTML file 
# Basic header of any table-generating HTML file

header = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<p> Table of testdata.csv </p>
<table style="width:75%"; border = "3px dashed black">
<BR>
"""
shbang = """
#!/usr/bin/python
print "Content-Type: text/html\n"
print ""
"""

    filler = ""
    filler += header # Right now, filler contains the header of any table-generating HTML script
    newinfo = ""
    for i in L:
